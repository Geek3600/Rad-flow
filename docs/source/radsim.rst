Installing Required Packages 
----------------------------

The telemetry visualization scripts in RAD-Sim as well as the NPU example design use a number of Python packages that need to be installed first.
This section provides instructions on how to set up these required packages in an Anaconda virtual environment.

## Downloading and Installing Anaconda

You can download Anaconda for Linux from this [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html) and follow the installation instructions on the same page or by executing the following command:
```
$ bash <path_to_downloaded_anaconda>/Anaconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
