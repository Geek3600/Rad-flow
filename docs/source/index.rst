Welcome to the RAD Flow documentation!
======================================

The RAD flow is an open-source academic architecture exploration and evaluation flow for novel beyond-FPGA reconfigurable acceleration devices (RADs). These devices incorporate conventional FPGA fabrics, several coarse-grained domain-specialized accelerator blocks, and high-performance packet-switched networks-on-chip (NoCs) for system-level communication.
